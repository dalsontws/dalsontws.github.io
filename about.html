					<h1>About
						Me</h1>
				</header>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>I am a graduating <b>Computer
						Engineering</b> student from the <a href="https://ceg.nus.edu.sg/"><b>National University of
							Singapore</b></a> and a <a
						href="https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/education-programmes/nus-overseas-colleges/"><b>NUS
							Overseas Colleges (NOC)</b></a> Alumni
					who is
					passionate about software development and innovation. The opportunity to develop new solutions to
					solve real world problems and make a significant impact to our community really excites me. I am a
					strong believer that the use of technology can improve the standard of living of people around us,
					and I really wish to play my part in creating new solutions for the world.</p>
				<p> Currently a Software Engineer Intern in <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/"><b>GovTech</b></a>
					(Government Digital Services), I am part of the HATS
					(Hive Agile Testing Solutions) team, where our mission is to develop comprehensive testing tools
					that can
					be relied on during the software development life cycle, and to deliver high quality digital
					services for our citizens. I developed an <b>accessibility testing tool</b> that identify possible
					accessibility violations on government web applications and provide recommendations on how to
					rectify these violations. After the entire process of requirement gathering, interviewing PWDs
					(Persons with Disabilities) and understanding our goal and mission, I realised that many e-services
					out there might be inadvertently excluding PWDs, and I felt the importance of my project
					and my role in developing this tool. I understood the importance of us, as software engineers, to
					develop and create solutions that benefit as many people as possible, and I am glad to see that we
					can make a difference in the lives of others. </p>
				<p>I was a Data Analyst and Software Developer Intern at <a
						href="https://www.airvisual.com/"><b>IQAir-AirVisual</b></a>, a big data, air quality
					monitoring company in Beijing. My role includes <b>data analytics</b> and <b>machine learning</b>
					for air pollution forecasting and developing web scraping algorithms to add more air quality
					monitoring stations in our database. We provide free real-time air quality data on our platform and
					manufacture low-cost air quality sensors, allowing people to be more aware of the air that they
					breathe in and the possible harmful effects of pollution.
					Our role was to raise
					awareness of this “invisible killer”, and what really resonated with me was that our air quality
					data not only informs the world-wide community, it also drives action from the government and
					empowers
					the people to put in measures to reduce air pollution and protect themselves. </p>
				<p>I am extremely passionate about continuous development and innovation. I enjoy participating in
					hackathons, winning 5 such competitions
					in Beijing, Prague and Singapore. I enjoy the entire process of ideating,
					developing our solution, and finally convincing the judges and our peers to buy-in to the product. I
					actively seek opportunities to challenge myself and solve real-world problems.</p>
				<p>I believe that as software engineers and IT professionals, we have the power to create value in our
					society. I wish to continue my journey of innovation and to give back to my community, creating new
					and improved solutions for the people around us.</p>
